Notes about additional files:

The following files derive from js_of_ocaml, and are under the LGPL 2:

  - jsoo_util/jsoo_dl.ml
  - coq-toplevel/jscoqtop.ml

We currently have no "direct derivative" from Coq, which is under the
LGPL 2.1, however:

  - icoq.ml was based on Coq's source at some point.

  - quite a bit of the Ocaml code is tightly integrated with Coq so it
    could be considered to derive from it.

The frameworks in external, pace, codemirror, etc... are under their
own licence, see the directories for more details.
