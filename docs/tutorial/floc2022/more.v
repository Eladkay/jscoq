 We are going to define a recursive function, [nonzeros],
 that filters out all the zeros from a list of [nat] elements.
 *)

Definition natlist := list nat.

Fixpoint nonzeros (l : natlist) :=
  match l with
  | [] => []
  | 0 :: xs => nonzeros xs
  | x :: xs => x :: nonzeros xs
  end.

(**
 Just to show you that it works:
 *)

Check nonzeros.
Compute nonzeros [5;6;0;7;0;9;8].

(**
 We will now prove that [nonzeros] distributes over [++] (list concatenation).
 First, we define a [simpl] hint, which will allow Coq tactics to expand its
 definition when it occurs in goals.

   the relevant documentation.</a>)#

Arguments nonzeros l : simpl nomatch.

(**
 _And now, to the proof_ !
*)

Lemma nonzeros_app : forall l1 l2 : natlist,
  nonzeros (l1 ++ l2) = (nonzeros l1) ++ (nonzeros l2).
Proof.

  Unsurprisingly, the proof progresses by induction on the first list, [l1].
